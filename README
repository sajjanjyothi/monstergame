solution
=========

Monster game created as per given instructions (Used CPP as primary language for solution)
This solution can be improved using STL maps.Used vector for simplicity.

Unit test
=========
All unit tests are captures using cppunit test framework(http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/doc/cvs/index.html)

Compilation
===========
Project can be compiled as make clean; make (This will create both solution binary and test binary)
Created maven project POM(Object model), I haven't tested this using maven

Used STL container Vector for map and monster storage
Algorithm find_if used for searching within container

Not Implemented
==============
I haven't implemented city removal correctly within processMonster (City routes also need to be removed)
Not tested with maven

Execution
==========
./main <number of monsters>

Unit Test Execution
===================
./unit_test
